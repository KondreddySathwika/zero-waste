Project Title :** Food Save

Selected Domain : Web Development

Project Statement : ZeroWaste – an AI-powered food donation platform with geo-intelligent matching

Abstract : Food waste is a critical global issue, with nearly 1.3 billion tons of food discarded annually while millions face hunger. Traditional food donation systems suffer from inefficiencies—lack of real-time coordination, poor visibility of surplus food, and manual processes that delay redistribution. FoodShare addresses these challenges by providing a digital platform that connects food donors (restaurants, bakeries, households) with NGOs and volunteers to ensure surplus food reaches those in need quickly and transparently.
The platform solves three core problems:

*Inefficient Matching: Manual coordination leads to delays and wasted food. FoodShare’s *real-time map and notifications instantly link donors with nearby recipients.
Lack of Tracking: Traditional systems lack accountability. FoodShare tracks donations end-to-end (posting → pickup → completion) with status updates.
Limited Impact Measurement: Donors rarely see their contribution’s impact. The platform quantifies results (meals delivered, CO₂ reduced) to encourage participation.
FoodShare leverages web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Leaflet.js for maps) to create an accessible, user-friendly solution. Key features include:
Role-specific dashboards for donors, NGOs, and admins
Automated expiry alerts** to prioritize urgent donations
Data-driven reports** to showcase community impact
By digitizing food redistribution, FoodShare reduces waste, fights hunger, and promotes sustainability—proving that technology can turn excess food into social good.
Notes: Problem-focused : Highlights inefficiencies in current systems.
Solution-oriented : Explains how FoodShare’s features address gaps.
Concise metrics : Uses data (1.3B tons wasted) to emphasize urgency.
calable : Could add case studies or user testimonials if space allows.
Tech Stack Used : HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript – Core web technologies for structure, styling, and interactivity. Tailwind CSS – Utility-first framework for responsive and modern UI components. Font Awesome – Icon library for intuitive UI elements. Leaflet.js – Interactive maps for real-time donation tracking and location visualization.

**Project Explanation **: FoodShare - Reducing Food Waste, Fighting Hunger Project Overview FoodShare is a web platform designed to connect food donors (restaurants, bakeries, individuals) with NGOs, shelters, and volunteers to redistribute surplus food efficiently. By digitizing food donations, we minimize waste, combat hunger, and promote sustainability in local communities. Key Features: Multi-Role System: Donors can post surplus food with details like type, quantity, expiry, and location NGOs can browse and claim donations through an interactive map Admins moderate users, approve posts, and track impact Real-Time Tracking: Tracks donation lifecycle from Pending to Scheduled, In Transit, and Completed Provides automated expiry alerts and pickup reminders Interactive Map: Visualizes nearby food donations with status indicators Color-coded markers show Fresh, Near Expiry, and Expired/Picked Up donations Impact Analytics: Tracks metrics like food saved (kg), people fed, and CO₂ emissions prevented Provides reports to demonstrate community impact User Management: Secure login system with role-based access control Profile customization and notification center Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript - Core structure and interactivity Tailwind CSS - Responsive UI components Leaflet.js - Interactive maps for donation visualization How It Works Donors post surplus food with details and images NGOs browse the map and claim available donations System provides real-time tracking from posting to completion Admins monitor activity and generate impact reports Future Enhancements Mobile application for on-the-go access AI-powered matching for optimal donor-NGO connections
